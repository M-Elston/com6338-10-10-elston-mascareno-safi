        <h2>REMEMBER</h2>
        <p>
          Before adopting, it is your responsibility to ask all necessary
          questions regarding the dog's background, health, behavior, and the
          adoption process. Make sure you fully understand the commitment you're
          making. Ask about return policies, medical needs, and any adoption
          fees or requirements.
