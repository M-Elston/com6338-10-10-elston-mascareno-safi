      <h1>Fetch A Fact & Furry Faces!</h1>

      <p>Did you know dogs are full of delightful surprises? Not only can they tell when you’ve been gone too long (because yes, they really do miss you!), but they also have 18 tiny muscles to wiggle their ears. Even more amazing, every dog’s nose print is one-of-a-kind, just like a human fingerprint! And if you’ve ever met a Dalmatian puppy, you might be surprised to learn that they’re born completely white; their iconic spots come in later, like freckles from nature.</p>
      
      <p><strong>Woof! Dogs are truly the cutest little wonders!</strong></p>
